Boxstrap: Repeatable Machine Configuration

Use Boxstrap instead of your system's package manager and 
you'll never have to remember what all to install on a machine again.

Boxstrap works by recording all of the packages and other things that
you install, quickly letting you set up a new machine next time, or 
recover your current machine after a rebuild or os upgrade.

Install:

cd ~
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaffo/boxstrap/master/ap-pip | sh

Usage:

Instead of apt-get install, run ap-sys. For instance:

instead of:

sudo apt-get install mysql

run:

ap-sys mysql
